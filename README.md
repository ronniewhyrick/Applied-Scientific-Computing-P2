Project II: Matrix Applications
Introduction to matrix manipulation in MATLAB as well as conceptual introductions into Linear Algebra and Statistical Concepts. 
Premise: Take example data files and find Confidence Distribution, Maximum Absolute Relative Error ARE, and Eigen Values & Vectors
Concatenated to my actual lab report was the same lab intro i was given to complete this project. This should give more insight into the specifics of the programs. 
****Note: Example data files that were manipulated were not included.
